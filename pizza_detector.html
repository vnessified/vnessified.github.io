          <h3>Problem &amp; Goals</h3>

<p><h4>Introducing Pizza Detector</h4>
Ever wonder if there is pizza in your immediate surroundings? Consider the scenario where you're at a party ‚Äî you've had one too many libations and things start to get kinda fuzzy... is that pizza or seven layer dip in front of you? It can be hard to tell, right?! Or let's say you find yourself in a TGI Fridays (completely ironically of course) and order a 'BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza' and you ask yourself "but is this really pizza?". Maybe you are currently on an all pizza diet and you're just tired of constantly mentally assessing whether food items are pizza or not. Or maybe you just really love pizza and think it would be silly but fun to detect pizza from, well, photos of pizza.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Ok but seriously...</h4>
Jokes aside, the actual goal of this project is to first create a tool that recognizes a specific food from a single image. A longer term goal would be to recognizes many other foods and then ultimately predict calories and other nutritional info from a photo. The use cases for this are pretty self-explanatory ‚Äî tracking food intake for weight loss or to manage medical conditions (ie diabetes, food allergies, etc) can be fairly labor intensive (and frankly annoying) as it usually requires manually entering nutritional info into a fitness/food tracking app. Because of this, most people don't stick with tracking their food intake for very long and this potentially can lead to weight gain and other health problems.</p>

<h3>Data Source</h3>

<p>We‚Äôve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>Data Cleaning &amp; Manipulation</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor‚Äôs GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
