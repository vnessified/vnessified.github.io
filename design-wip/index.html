			<h3 align=center>Greetings fellow internet person &#x1F44B;</h3> <br>

			<p>	I'm a hyper-curious and multi-hyphenate creative, more pretentiously known as a "renaissance woman", combining my background in both art and  science to create engaging and compelling experiences for a wide range of audiences. Some of my other interests include acting, improv, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vnessified?lang=en" target="_blank">roller-skating</a>. Having fun is my jam, so I bring that energy to everything I do. 


			</p>
			<br>

			<p>
				I currently work on projects across a variety of domains needing high-level creative direction including branding, marketing, and product design, as well as copywriting and content strategy. Check out my <a href="../Vanessa_Grass_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>, see examples of my work below, and/or read my <a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/4278/" target="_blank"> master's thesis</a> if you feel like mildly hurting your brain.	 </p> <br>
			<h4 align=center >
			Please <a href="mailto:vnesag@gmail.com">email me</a> if you have any interesting projects that need creative talent!

				<h2>Logos &amp; Branding</h2>
				
				<p>
					 I'm grateful to have worked with some fantastic organizations, companies, and businesses to create logos and branding systems. Some of my favorites include working with the PAWS Humane Society, a volunteer-based animal shelter to create a playful yet earnest graphic type treatment. While working as lead designer at Riot9, a Chicago area tech startup, I collaborated closely with the founder to develop an assertive and refined logotype. Another fun project aimed at teaching high school students to code, involved creating an approachable yet "techy" branding system for Codeship. Last but not least, I created a peppy and quirky brand identity for Peppercorn, a small business specializing in gourmet spicy flavored popcorn products.

					 An infographic illustration created for an academic publication on the science behind sleep, targeting a lay-person audience.

				<h2>NuReveal Skincare</h2>
				<h6>Branding &amp; Marketing</h6>
				
				<p>
					 <a href="https://www.nureveal.com/" target="_blank"> NuReveal Skincare </a> is an indie skincare line focusing on non-synthetic and paraben-free, high-quality, naturally-derived ingredients. I worked one-on-one with the founder to ideate on several branding, marketing, and product touchpoints, including multiple business card designs. The winning concept focused first and foremost on beautiful skin, highlighting the skincare products while promoting the brand's Instagram account, all aligned with the founder's goals for the company.

				<h6>Social Media Content</h6>
				
				<p>
					 With the aim of reaching and expanding to a more diverse consumer group than the traditional NuReveal customer, I solely strategized concepts, copywriting, and videography for the skincare line's TikTok account, staying up-to-date with trends on TikTok while adding a unique twist. The overall vision is to highlight NuReveal's cruelty-free, naturally-derived skincare products in amusing and delightful storylines, emphasizing the skincare's ability to target and treat various skin concerns in a youth enhancing, natural, and nourishing manner.
