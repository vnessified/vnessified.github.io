				<h2>NuReveal Skincare Branding</h2>
				
				<p>
					 <a href="https://www.nureveal.com/" target="_blank"> NuReveal Skincare </a> is an indie skincare line focusing on non-synthetic and paraben-free, high-quality, naturally-derived ingredients. I worked one-on-one with the founder to collaborate on several branding, marketing, and product touchpoints, including multiple business card designs. The winning concept focused first and foremost on beautiful skin, highlighting the skincare products while promoting the brand's Instagram account, all aligned with the founder's goals for the company.

				<h2>NuReveal Social Media Content</h2>
				
				<p>
					 With the aim of reaching and expanding to a more diverse consumer group than the traditional NuReveal customer, I solely strategized concepts, copywriting, and videography for the skincare line's <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nurevealskincare" target="_blank">TikTok account</a>, keeping aware of current trends on TikTok while adding a unique twist. The overall vision is to highlight NuReveal's cruelty-free, naturally-derived skincare products in amusing and delightful storylines, emphasizing the skincare's ability to target and treat various skin concerns in a natural and nourishing manner.
