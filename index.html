          <h3>Background</h3>

<p>Working as a UI/UX designer for several years I've collaborated closely with data scientists and analysts and have found myself increasingly more and more interested in exploring and solving problems at the data level rather than at the pixel level. In the past this has manifested itself in my interest in funnel analysis and conversion rates, predicting user behavior, and the potential applications of computer vision in the image based products I worked on. From there, my interests in data science snowballed from using data to inform my designs to being a full-fledged passion.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/vnessified/DSI-SF-2-vnessified" class="text-links" target="_blank">GA coursework</a>
  <br>
  Completed a three month immersive program where I utilized real world data science skills such as python (with the help of pandas, NumPy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, Keras, etc) for data cleaning and manipulation, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, statisical modeling, predictive analysis and machine learning.

<br>

<br>
For my final project, I developed and trained a neural network that recognizes a specific food category (in this case pizza) with 88% accuracy from a single image of pizza. A longer term goal would be to expand the network to be a multi-label classifier that recognizes many other food categories and then ultimately predicts calories and other nutritional info from a photo.</p>
